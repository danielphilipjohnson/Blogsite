          Biography
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-8 text-lg">
          I discovered programming as a young child by helping my mother program
          the game Blue Meanies from Outer Space into the Commodore 64 (CBM 64)
          memory. Then while at college, I spent my free time playing Xbox and
          came across XNA Game Studio 3.0 in 2008. This idea of making games for
          Xbox seemed cool to me. So I started to learn C# and eventually built
          an RPG game from the toolkit they provided. After I finished college,
          I progressed to university studying psychology with little free time.
          My next year I switched to neuroscience where once again I fell in
          love with programming. It required using a samba Linux server and
          creating experiments with python and using libraries such as pandas,
          NumPy and matplotlib to plot and analysis data. Then slowly in my free
          time, I started learning web development with freecodecamp and udacity
          and late moving to react.

          Why React?
        </h2>
        <div className="mb-8 text-lg">
          <p className="mb-6">
            When using a library or framework, what you need is something that
            is continuously supported and maintained. React is maintained by
            Facebook and a strong community.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-6">
            React is constantly updated with new features, recently with hooks,
            everything you need to successfully complete your project is there
            and adding customizations like useAuth and useForm is a breeze.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Once you learn the React library, you are able to build native apps
            for IOS and Android with the React Native Framework and for Desktop
            Apps React NodeGui.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, it is easy to learn.</p>

          Why Did I Start This Blog?
        </h2>
        <div className="mb-8 text-lg">
          <p className="mb-6">
            Recently I started to blog, mainly to expand my expertise, because
            as im sure you know the best way to learn - is to teach it.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            I have started to narrow down my topics to write about. If you have
            any front end development areas you are interested in let me know on
            twitter.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Almost everyday I am working with JavaScript, React, Gatsby, Next.js
            and TailwindCSS. When I identify a gap in my knowledge I will write
            about it. Sometimes you spend a lot of time with a certain topic you
            start to forget things. When this happens i'll start to write about
            the topic and yes I do tend to forget the basics. Sometimes React
            can spoil you when it comes back to working with the DOM.
          </p>

            Please Note: Do not treat my blogs as the sole source of truth.
            Please think critically and evaluate it for yourself. Sometimes my
            blogs cannot cover the whole topic. I might not have the time to
            write 100% about a topic. Please be aware of that. The internet can
            be a great place, you can find more complete explanations I am sure.
            I always try to write in the simplest terms and provide information
            in a managable way. If you feel some areas are not easy to grasp
            please provide me with feedback.
