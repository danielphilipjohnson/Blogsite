Then while at college, I spent my free time playing Xbox and\n          came across XNA Game Studio 3.0 in 2008. This idea of making games for\n          Xbox seemed cool to me. So I started to learn C# and eventually built\n          an RPG game from the toolkit they provided. After I finished college,\n          I progressed to university studying psychology with little free time.\n          My next year I switched to neuroscience where once again I fell in\n          love with programming. It required using a samba Linux server and\n          creating experiments with python and using libraries such as pandas,\n          NumPy and matplotlib to plot and analysis data. Then slowly in my free\n          time, I started learning web development with freecodecamp and udacity\n          and late moving to react.\n        </p>\n\n        {/* <h2 className=\"text-3xl mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-gray-200\">\n          Experience\n        </h2>\n        look to cv\n        <p className=\"mb-4\">FHDSKJFHSDJKF</p> */}\n\n        <h2 className=\"text-3xl mb-4 pb-2 border-b border-gray-200\">\n          Why React?\n        </h2>\n        <div className=\"mb-8 text-lg\">\n          <p className=\"mb-6\">\n            When using a library or framework, what you need is something that\n            is continuously supported and maintained.

When this happens i'll start to write about\n            the topic and yes I do tend to forget the basics.
